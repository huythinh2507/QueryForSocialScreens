## üè¶ A. Customer Nodes Exploration

**1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?**

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;
CREATE TEMP TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS (
SELECT
  TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY') AS week_date,
  DATE_PART('week', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS week_number,

## üõç B. Data Exploration

**1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?**

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT(TO_CHAR(week_date, 'day')) AS week_day

````

**Answer:**

|week_day|
|:----|
|monday|

- Monday is used for the `week_date` value.

**2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?**

````sql

)
SELECT 
  all_weeks.week_number
FROM 
  all_weeks
LEFT JOIN used_weeks ON all_weeks.week_number = used_weeks.week_number
WHERE used_weeks.week_number IS NULL;
