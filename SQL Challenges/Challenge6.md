## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª B. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

1. How many times was each product viewed?
2. How many times was each product added to cart?
3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
4. How many times was each product purchased?

## Planning Our Strategy

Let us visualize the output table.

| Column | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| product | Name of the product |
| views | Number of views for each product |
| cart_adds | Number of cart adds for each product |
| abandoned | Number of times product was added to a cart, but not purchased |
| purchased | Number of times product was purchased |

These information would come from these 2 tables.
- `events` table - visit_id, page_id, event_type
- `page_hierarchy` table - page_id, product_category

**Solution**

- Note 1 - In `product_page_events` CTE, find page views and cart adds for individual visit ids by wrapping `SUM` around `CASE statements` so that we do not have to group the results by `event_type` as well.
- Note 2 - In `purchase_events` CTE, get only visit ids that have made purchases.
- Note 3 - In `combined_table` CTE, merge `product_page_events` and `purchase_events` using `LEFT JOIN`. Take note of the table sequence. In order to filter for visit ids with purchases, we use a `CASE statement` and where visit id is not null, it means the visit id is a purchase. 

```sql
WITH product_page_events AS ( -- Note 1
  SELECT 
    e.visit_id,
    ph.product_id,
    ph.page_name AS product_name,
    ph.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view, -- 1 for Page View
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add -- 2 for Add Cart
  FROM clique_bait.events AS e
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph
    ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
  WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY e.visit_id, ph.product_id, ph.page_name, ph.product_category
),
purchase_events AS ( -- Note 2
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM clique_bait.events
  WHERE event_type = 3 -- 3 for Purchase
),
combined_table AS ( -- Note 3
  SELECT 
    ppe.visit_id, 
    ppe.product_id, 
    ppe.product_name, 
    ppe.product_category, 
    ppe.page_view, 
    ppe.cart_add,
    CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
  FROM product_page_events AS ppe
  LEFT JOIN purchase_events AS pe
    ON ppe.visit_id = pe.visit_id
),
product_info AS (
  SELECT 
    product_name, 
    product_category, 
    SUM(page_view) AS views,
    SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
  FROM combined_table
  GROUP BY product_id, product_name, product_category)

SELECT *
FROM product_info
ORDER BY product_id;
```

The logic behind `abandoned` column in which `cart_add = 1` where a customer adds an item into the cart, but `purchase = 0` customer did not purchase and abandoned the cart.

***

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

**Solution**

```sql
WITH product_page_events AS ( -- Note 1
  SELECT 
    e.visit_id,
    ph.product_id,
    ph.page_name AS product_name,
    ph.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view, -- 1 for Page View
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add -- 2 for Add Cart
  FROM clique_bait.events AS e
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph
    ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
  WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY e.visit_id, ph.product_id, ph.page_name, ph.product_category
),
purchase_events AS ( -- Note 2
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM clique_bait.events
  WHERE event_type = 3 -- 3 for Purchase
),
combined_table AS ( -- Note 3
  SELECT 
    ppe.visit_id, 
    ppe.product_id, 
    ppe.product_name, 
    ppe.product_category, 
    ppe.page_view, 
    ppe.cart_add,
    CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
  FROM product_page_events AS ppe
  LEFT JOIN purchase_events AS pe
    ON ppe.visit_id = pe.visit_id
),
product_category AS (
  SELECT 
    product_category, 
    SUM(page_view) AS views,
    SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
  FROM combined_table
  GROUP BY product_category)

SELECT *
FROM product_category
```

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

**1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**

**2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?**

<kbd><img width="820" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 4 18 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/136650364-0f44ac58-8be7-4f4e-89a7-2598a24af5ce.png"></kbd>

- Oyster has the most views.
- Lobster has the most cart adds and purchases.
- Russian Caviar is most likely to be abandoned.

**3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?**

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name, 
  product_category, 
  ROUND(100 * purchases/views,2) AS purchase_per_view_percentage
FROM product_info
ORDER BY purchase_per_view_percentage DESC
```

- Lobster has the highest view to purchase percentage at 48.74%.

**4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?**

**5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?**

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(100*AVG(cart_adds/views),2) AS avg_view_to_cart_add_conversion,
  ROUND(100*AVG(purchases/cart_adds),2) AS avg_cart_add_to_purchases_conversion_rate
FROM product_info
```

- Average views to cart adds rate is 60.95% and average cart adds to purchases rate is 75.93%.
- Although the cart add rate is lower, but the conversion of potential customer to the sales funnel is at least 15% higher.

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª C. Campaigns Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)
  
**Solution**

Steps:
- We will merge multiple tables:
  - Using INNER JOIN for `users` and `events` table
  - Joining `campaign_identifier` table using LEFT JOIN as we want all lines that have `event_time` between `start_date` and `end_date`. 
  - Joining `page_hierachy` table using LEFT JOIN as we want all the rows in the `page_hierachy` table
- To generate earliest `visit_start_time` for each unique `visit_id`, use `MIN()` to find the 1st `visit_time`. 
- Wrap `SUM()` with CASE statement in order to find the total number of counts for `page_views`, `cart_adds`, `purchase`, ad `impression` and ad `click`.
- To get a list of products added into cart sorted by sequence, 
-   Firstly, use a CASE statement to only get cart add events. 
-   Then, use `STRING_AGG()` to separate products by comma `,` and sort the sequence using `sequence_number`.

```sql
SELECT 
  u.user_id, e.visit_id, 
  MIN(e.event_time) AS visit_start_time,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
  c.campaign_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click, 
  STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN p.product_id IS NOT NULL AND e.event_type = 2 THEN p.page_name ELSE NULL END, 
    ', ' ORDER BY e.sequence_number) AS cart_products
FROM clique_bait.users AS u
INNER JOIN clique_bait.events AS e
  ON u.cookie_id = e.cookie_id
LEFT JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier AS c
  ON e.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
LEFT JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS p
  ON e.page_id = p.page_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, e.visit_id, c.campaign_name;
```
